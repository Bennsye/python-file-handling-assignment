🐍 Python File Handling & Exception Handling Assignment
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of file handling and exception handling in Python. It is designed to show how files can be read, modified, and written back to disk, while also ensuring the program handles errors gracefully when unexpected issues occur.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand how to open, read, and write files in Python.

Gain experience with modifying file content (adding line numbers).

Learn how to implement exception handling using try/except blocks.

Develop robust and error-tolerant applications.

🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge

Reads content from input.txt.

Modifies the content by adding line numbers.

Writes the result into output.txt.

🧪 Error Handling Lab

Prompts the user to enter a filename.

Displays the file content if it exists and is readable.

Gracefully handles errors such as:

File not found (FileNotFoundError).

Permission denied (PermissionError).

Other unexpected errors.
